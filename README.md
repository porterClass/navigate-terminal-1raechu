# Welcome!

This is a game to teach you the basics of using a POSIX (Linux, BSD, UNIX) terminal.


## How to Start

To start playing, open a terminal.

Type the letters `cd` (just the letters and a space, not the quote marks) into the terminal...

Then a space (press the spacebar)...

Then type the location you want to change to. In this case you probaly want to start at `entrance` 


You now have something like this in your terminal window:

```
$ cd /home/your_username/Downloads/bashcrawl/entrance
```

(The exact path to the entrance varies, depending on where you saved the file, so it's OK if it looks a little different on your computer.)

Press RETURN on your keyboard.

Your first move is very important.
Type this into your terminal:

```
cat scroll
```

You are now playing the game..
